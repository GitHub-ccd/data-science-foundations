I have shown you how to transform qualitative features into quantitative ones, and this is quite useful for computing summary statistics, doing bootstrap and making visualizations, but now we are starting to be interested in prediction. For this we will need to do a slightly different feature transformaiton for qualitative variables and we will need to do some cleaning of quantitative variables too. These steps are outlines below:\n",

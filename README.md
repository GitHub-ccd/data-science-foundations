# TODOS

## Foundations

3. Random Variables - is this a good description/definition of a r.v.
4. Simulating randomness is basically asking how we take the mean or plot the distribution of a r.v.
5. Is IID explained well enough/is it correct
6. Bootstrapping is very very important, I definitely need to revisit this. Any suggestions?
7. For the confidence intervals and tests, I am pretty sure the hypothesis test is wrong. I will most likely remove the hypothesis testing in the final version.
9. In the single hypothesis testing, is the connection clear. Does the bootstrap confidence interval make sense?
10. The multiple hypothesis learning section could perhaps be dropped. The union bound is pretty complex. 
12. For error and noise it would be nice if ACC, MAE and MSE achieved three different orderings - have not thought too much on it, but data point suggestions would be appreciated
13. For the infinite hypothesis set, the generalization error should be bigger with infinite hypotheses
14. The code here could be cleaned up
15. Code here could also be cleaned up. One part of me wonders whether I should use regularization to do this instead. Any suggestions on data sets? Notice the heat maps at the bottom could look nicer.
16. This one could really use a better data example the heat maps could be much better. Any suggestions.
19. Here I should really make clear the connection to bootstrapping (the larger the sample the less variance/narrower the confidence interval). 
20. Boosting… my issue here is that this does not really fit in with the theme of the class. I am thinking about doing it in the practical class, but I will likely not do it for the theoretical.
21. Anything else I should add here?
22. I might combine this with the previous one

General Note:
If I move regularization before the noise lecture then I can use it during that lecture. And it might lead to smoother graphs…

## Practicals
7. Will need to delete the hypo testing

General Note:
This is an addition that I was not all too into. So the quality feels lower than the foundational material. So this needs a lot of help. I want to keep it minimal, but I don’t want to skip on anything too important.
